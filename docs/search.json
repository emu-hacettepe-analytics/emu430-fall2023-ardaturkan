    "text": "Three Differences Between R and Python.\nAlthough there are many similarities between Python and R languages that are frequently used today, there are also very clear and fundamental differences. We can summarize these three fundamental differences as follows:\n\nAssignment Operator\nWhile in Python, the assignment operator is a single equality sign “=”, in R, the assignment operator can also be expressed as “&lt;-”, and for the sake of code clarity and convention, the use of “&lt;-” is recommended by the community.\nPython\n\ndue_date_assignment = \"November 03, 2023\" \nprint(due_date_assignment)\n\nNovember 03, 2023\n\n\nR\n\ndue_date_assignment &lt;- \"November 03, 2023\"\nprint(due_date_assignment)\n\n[1] \"November 03, 2023\"\n\n\n\n\nIndentation\nPython indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In other words, the lines which belongs to same block of code must have a same indent. In R, there is no such obligation. However, indentation is recommended for ease of coding and reading.\nPython\n\ndue_date_assignment = \"November 03, 2023\" \n  print(due_date_assignment)\n\nunexpected indent (&lt;string&gt;, line 2)\n\n\nR\n\ndue_date_assignment &lt;- \"November 03, 2023\"\n  print(due_date_assignment)\n\n[1] \"November 03, 2023\"\n\n\n\n\nIndexing"
